# AnalyticalGuiding
Path guiding analytical solution simple numerical experiments. This repo is for the 2D | 1D numerical and interactive visualization of my DARTS paper. See [Enigmatisms/DARTS](https://github.com/Enigmatisms/DARTS) for more information.

I am too lazy to work on documenting how this repo works, since this repo is only for numerical experiments. There are multiple executables, but I will only showcase one of them: the visualization of 2D DARTS.
```shell
python ./viz_dpg.py
```
